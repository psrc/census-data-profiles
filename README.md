# Census Data Profiles
This repository contains scripts that create Census Data Profiles from the Census API for selected geogrpahies.

The Data Profiles created are specified in the census_profile_descriptions file and default to:
* DP02
* DP03
* DP04
* DP05

In order for the script to run, you need have a valid census api key. If you don't have a key, go to https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
